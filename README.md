# Note-hub

Problems to be solved:

## Front-end:
1. We have make a page for search results
2. We have to make a search pannel

## Back-end:
1. We are taking the some redundant information of the users in the contribution form which should be fetched from the database because we know who is logged in 
2. The passwords are kept in the database in raw format which should be bcrypt hashed 
3. we should work with JWT and cookie based auth
